\begin{abstract}
We use SDSS imaging data in $ugriz$ passbands to study the shape of the
point spread function (PSF) profile and the variation of its width with 
wavelength and time. We find that the PSF profile is well described by 
theoretical predictions based on \vk's turbulence theory. The observed 
profile can be parametrized by only two parameters, the profile's full width
at half maximum (FWHM) and a normalization of the contribution of an empirically determined 
``instrumental'' PSF. The profile shape is very similar to the ``double gaussian
plus power-law wing'' decomposition used by SDSS image processing pipeline, 
but here it is successfully modeled with two free model parameters, rather than six as in SDSS pipeline. 
The FWHM variation with wavelength folows the
$\lambda^{\alpha}$ power law, where $\alpha \approx-0.3$ and correlated
with the FWHM itself. The observed behavior is much better described by \vk's turbulence 
theory with the outer scale parameter in the range 5--100 m, than by the 
Kolmogorov's turbulence theory. We also measure the temporal and angular
structure functions for FWHM and compare them to simulations and
results from literature. The angular structure function saturates at scales beyond 0.5$-$1.0 degree. 
The power spectrum of the temporal behavior is found to be broadly consistent with 
a damped random walk model with characteristic timescale in the range $\sim10-30$ minutes, 
though data show a shallower high-frequency behavior. The latter is well fit 
by a single power law with index in the range $-1.5$ to $-1.0$. A hybrid model 
is likely needed to fully capture both the low-frequency and high-frequency 
behavior of the temporal variations of atmospheric seeing.
