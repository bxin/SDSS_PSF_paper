\begin{abstract}
We use SDSS imaging data in $ugriz$ passbands to study the shape of
point spread function (PSF) profile and the variation of its width with 
wavelength and time. We find that the PSF profile is well described by 
theoretical predictions based on von Karman's turbulence theory and
can be parametrized by a single parameter, the profile's FWHM (full width
at half maximum). The profile shape is very similar to the ``double gaussian
plus power-law wing'' decomposition used by SDSS, but here it is modeled 
with a single free model parameter, rather than six as in SDSS pipeline. 
The FWHM variation with wavelength folows the
$\lambda^{-0.3}$ power law. We also measure the temporal and angular
structure functions for FWHM and find lots of interesting results \dots

\section{The PSF profile analysis}

Compare to SDSS, emphasize superiority of 1 parameter vs. 6 parameters fit

Discuss profile shape stability when the seeing is rapidly  changing

  curve convolved with the instrument PSF, where the scaling factor on
  the tail component is allowed to vary.
\label{fig:psffit}}
\end{figure}

\section{The analysis of FWHM behavior} 

Now that we understand (heopfully) that the seeing is by and large described by 
a single parameter, FWHM, we study three aspects of its variation, as follows.


\subsection{The FWHM dependence on wavelength} 

Asumming a power law, FWHM$\propto \lambda^{-\alpha}$, what can we say 
about $\alpha$ distribution? 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{FIGURES/fwhm_lambda.png}
\caption{FWHM as functions of wavelength for run 3427.
\label{fig:fwhm_lambda}}
\end{figure}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{FIGURES/f3.eps}
\caption{statistics for $\alpha$ from all 109 runs.
\label{fig:alpha_stat}}
\end{figure}


Why is SDSS PSF different for the $i$ band? The $i$ band psf has ``stronger tails''
becuse of scattering in the CCD.  The Si is transparent at long $i$-band wavelengths 
so light goes all the way through the chip and is reflected off the solder, and passes 
back up through the Si. This effect is not visible in the $z$ band because in this case
thick front-side chips are used (in all other bands, thin back-side chips are used). 


\subsection{Angular structure function} 

Cross-correlation of FWHM for 6 camera columns and the measurement of the angular
structure function (that is, the covariance vs. angular distance). 

\begin{figure}

\caption{statistics for correlation coefficients from all 109 runs.
\label{fig:alpha_stat}}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Temporal auto-correlation function}

Study the temporal power spectrum:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let's start with plain Fourier transform and look at power spectra (we can 
    play games with co-addition, 6 columns for a given run, or all runs)
\item Potentially, we could also look at  Kelly and Becker code  (2014, ApJ 788, 33) 
\item Here we can compare to Chuck's CP measurements (in opsim db) 
\end{itemize}

----------Completed: ----------------

ZI:  find exact definition of neff_psf (is it based on fit or input data?) 
Bo: add analysis directory and py code 


1)  make files, one per run, as a function of field number, with
- field, camera column, bandpass, 
- one-parameter fit FWHM from fitting von Karman profile
- other SDSS params: psf_width, airmass, mjd, psf_nstar, neff_psf, sky_frames 


E.g. for some run
#  field  camCol  filter   FWHMvK    (other SDSS params)

2) plot FWHMvK vs. psf_width for 30 panels 

-----use a Gaussian as convolution kernel, remake fits -------

Bo:
check neff_psf from the vK fit and compare to 2G fit.
(checked fwhmeff, i.e., fwhmvk, and compared to psf_width from the 2G
fit. Generally the agreement is good. When they don't agree very well,
visually checking the vK fit vs the 2G fit shows that the vK fit often
gives the more reasonable agreement between data and fit.)
------make RMS (x - data) plots to quantify -----------
            /n(-1?) for 1-4, 5+ separately
            exclude bad 2G fits

3) plot alpha (index for lambda dep.) histograms for all data and for 
    two realizations of ``longest stretch'' selection
(not very conclusive, due to z-band tipping upward. The i-band could
be problematic too)

----------to do ----------------

---alpha vs seeing, col#6, col#3
??? masterTXT, a column to flag failed 2D fits?
???(in the master txt file for alpha, add seeing as a column)

4) plot profiles for a range of fields when the seeing is rapidly changing (is profile shape changing?) 


-------------Analysis structure: -----------------

1) profile discussion
- compare to SDSS, emphasize 1 parameter vs. 6 parameters
- discuss profile shape stability when seeing is changing rapidly

2) dependence on wavelength

- what is alpha distribution? 

3) cross-correlation of camera columns and measurement of structure function
    (that is, the covariance vs. angular distance) 

---for each run, each filter, make plot of cov vs separation
----fit through (0,1), plot slope as a function of seeing

4) auto-correlation function (and power spectrum) for temporal variation

- let's start with plain Fourier transform and look at power spectra (we can 
    play games with co-addition, 6 columns for a given run, or all runs)
- potentially, we could also look at  Kelly and Becker code  (2014, ApJ 788, 33) 
- here we can compare to Chuck's CP measurements (in opsim db) 

---for each run, each filter, camcol (#2,3), make D vs frequency.
