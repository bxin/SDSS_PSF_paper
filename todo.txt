%% to finish before submission

- LSST affiliation may need more detail (street?)
- keywords might be inconsistent what the journal would suggest 
- run 4874, field 0: is it really field 0 (usually SDSS runs start at ~10 or so);
     could it be that 0 is (field-fieldStart)?  Actually, it seems that fieldStart=11, see
        http://classic.sdss.org/dr7/coverage/sndr7.html
- same problem for run 94 (startField=12); I fixed both in text, but couldn't fix 
   titles in figures (which I understand you are removing any way)
- eq. 11: is gamma really inside, or perhaps outside brackets? (as in DRW model)
- please add DRW curve to the left panel in fig. 8 (see revised caption and added 
   discussion of DRW SF after eq. 11

----------Completed: ----------------

ZI:  find exact definition of neff_psf (is it based on fit or input data?) 
Bo: add analysis directory and py code 


1)  make files, one per run, as a function of field number, with
- field, camera column, bandpass, 
- one-parameter fit FWHM from fitting \vk profile
- other SDSS params: psf_width, airmass, mjd, psf_nstar, neff_psf, sky_frames 


E.g. for some run
#  field  camCol  filter   FWHMvK    (other SDSS params)

2) plot FWHMvK vs. psf_width for 30 panels 

-----use a Gaussian as convolution kernel, remake fits -------

Bo:
check neff_psf from the vK fit and compare to 2G fit.
(checked fwhmeff, i.e., fwhmvk, and compared to psf_width from the 2G
fit. Generally the agreement is good. When they don't agree very well,
visually checking the vK fit vs the 2G fit shows that the vK fit often
gives the more reasonable agreement between data and fit.)
------make RMS (x - data) plots to quantify -----------
            /n(-1?) for 1-4, 5+ separately
            exclude bad 2G fits

3) plot alpha (index for lambda dep.) histograms for all data and for 
    two realizations of ``longest stretch'' selection
(not very conclusive, due to z-band tipping upward. The i-band could
be problematic too)

----------to do ----------------

---alpha vs seeing, col#6, col#3
??? masterTXT, a column to flag failed 2D fits?
???(in the master txt file for alpha, add seeing as a column)

4) plot profiles for a range of fields when the seeing is rapidly changing (is profile shape changing?) 


-------------Analysis structure: -----------------

1) profile discussion
- compare to SDSS, emphasize 1 parameter vs. 6 parameters
- discuss profile shape stability when seeing is changing rapidly

2) dependence on wavelength

- what is alpha distribution? 

3) cross-correlation of camera columns and measurement of structure function
    (that is, the covariance vs. angular distance) 

---for each run, each filter, make plot of cov vs separation
----fit through (0,1), plot slope as a function of seeing

4) auto-correlation function (and power spectrum) for temporal variation

- let's start with plain Fourier transform and look at power spectra (we can 
    play games with co-addition, 6 columns for a given run, or all runs)
- potentially, we could also look at  Kelly and Becker code  (2014, ApJ 788, 33) 
- here we can compare to Chuck's CP measurements (in opsim db) 

---for each run, each filter, camcol (#2,3), make D vs frequency.

FWHM vs. field analysis

1040: 122 fields, oscillations on 5 min timescale, look at PSD 
2583: 227 fields, excellent seeing (1.1 in r) 
2662: 469 fields, long with typical seeing, with worst at the end
2709: 263 fields, oscillations on 5 min timescale, look at PSD 
2728: 488 fields, long with good seeing (1.2 in r) 
3325: 493 fields, long with typical seeing, with worst at the start
3360: 513 fields, typical but very variable seeing
3384: 784 fields, a long and *very* oscillatory run
3388: 713 fields, very different PSD than for 3384 
4145: 505 fields, steady deterioration from 1 arcsec to ~2 arcsec
4198: 747 fields, another long run with typical and oscillatory seeing
4203: 777 fields, another long run
4207: 753 fields, another long run
4849: 918 fields, a long run, typical seeing 
4868: 609 fields, another long run
4874: 981 fields, the longest run, typical seeing   *poster child* 


I would exclude runs with fewer than 100 fields from our analysis 






%check autocorrelation?
% - fig. 2: average autocorrelation function of seeing over 9 months:  A*exp(-t/tau) 
% see Eq. (3) in VMT 1998 for definition.
% This could be calculated using correlate_temporal_bin.py (autocor
% option), or make a copy of correlate_temporal_sf.py, and calculate
% in a similar way. But, in fig 2 of VMT 1998, why autocor(dt=0) not
% at 1?

%The seeing auto-correlation function
%\begin{equation}
%      C(\Delta t) = < \theta(t) \theta(t+\Delta t)>,
%\end{equation} 
%can be modeled as
%\begin{equation}
%      C(\Delta t) = A \, \exp(-\Delta t/\tau),
%\end{equation}
