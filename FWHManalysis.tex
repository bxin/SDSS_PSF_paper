%  \section{The analysis of FWHM behavior} 

Now that we understand that the seeing is by and large described by 
a single parameter, FWHM, we study three aspects of its variation, as follows.


\subsection{The FWHM dependence on wavelength} 

The Kolmogorov turbulence theory gives a standard formula for the FWHM of a long-exposure
seeing-limited PSF in a large telescope,
\begin{equation}
FWHM^{Kolm}(\lambda, X) = \frac{0.976\lambda}{r_0(\lambda,X)}.
\label{eq:fwhmkolm}
\end{equation}
Here $\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $X$ is the airmass.
We use $\lambda = 500$nm as the reference wavelength,
\begin{equation}
r_0(\lambda,X) = r_0(500) \left(\frac{\lambda}{500}\right)^{1.2}
\frac{1}{X^{0.6}},
\label{eq:r0}
\end{equation}
where $r_0(500)$ is the $r_0$ for $\lambda=500$nm and $X$=1, and $\lambda$ is in
the unit of nm.
Substituting Eq.~(\ref{eq:r0}) into (\ref{eq:fwhmkolm}), it is easy to see
\begin{equation}
FWHM^{Kolm} \propto \lambda^{-0.2}.
\end{equation}


With the von Karman atmosphere model, the FWHM as in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:fwhmkolm}) needs an additional correction factor
which is a function of the outer scale $L_0$~\citep{Tokovinin2002},
\begin{equation}
FWHM^{vonK}(\lambda, X) = \frac{0.976\lambda}{r_0(\lambda,X)}
\sqrt{1-2.183\left( \frac{r_0(\lambda,X) }{L_0} \right)^{0.356}}.
\end{equation}
If we still want to write $FWHM^{vonK} \propto \lambda^{\alpha} $, 
$\alpha$ will be a function of $L_0$ and $r_0$ at a specified
wavelength and airmass, or equivalently, $L_0$ and $FWHM^{vonK}$ at a
specified wavelength and airmass. Below, we will use SDSS 
PSF FWHM measurements from the 
$r$-band,
whose effective wavelength is 616.6 nm, and airmass of 1.
In this work, we always use FWHM to refer to FWHM$^{vonK}$.

For each run from SDSS Stripe 82 data, and each camera column, we make
a least-square fit to
all the simultaneous FWHM measurements across the optical bands, to
estimate the power parameter $\alpha$.
All FWHM are multiplied with $1/X^{0.6}$ to correct for airmass.
We take into account that the same field number doesn't correspond to the same
time in all filters. The scanning order in the SDSS camera is $r$-$i$-$u$-$z$-$g$, with the delay between the two 
successive filters corresponding to 2 fields. That is, If we take the field number $F$ for the $r$-band, then
we need to take FWHM for the $i$-band from field $F-2$, for the u band
from $F-4$, and so on. Fig.~\ref{fig:fwhm_lambda} shows such fits for
run 4874. All FWHM are normalized using corresponding FWHM in the
$r$-band taken at the same moment in time.
Significant deviation from $\alpha = -0.2$, as predicted by the
Kolmogorov model, can be seen in most bands.

also shown.

\end{figure}

As discussed above, based on the von Karman atmosphere model, the
power $\alpha$ should be a function of outer scale $L_0$ and the
FWHM in a specified optical band.
Fig.~\ref{fig:alpha_fwhm} is a scattered plot of $\alpha$ versus FWHM
in the $r$-band, for all the Stripe 82 runs.
A correlation between $\alpha$ and the FWHM seems to be present.
Similar correlations have been seen in Subaru images and reported by~\cite{subaruSeeing2016}.
The data points are overlaid with curves as predicted by the von
Karman model, with varying $L_0$, ranging from 2 meters to infinity.
The data clear deviate from the Kolmogorov model prediction, which is
the horizontal line at $\alpha = -0.20$, with infinite $L_0$.
For LSST, using the commonly assumed $L_0 = 30$m, and a FWHM of 0.6
arcsec, we get a $\alpha$ value close to $-0.30$.

\subsection{Angular structure function} 

To examine the spatial correlation of the FWHM we compute the angular
structure function using PSF measurements from all 6 camera columns.
Our structure function is defined as
the root-mean-square of the PSF size differences of pairs of stars
in the same angular bin. 
Results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:spatial}.
The SDSS curves are combined for all the Stripe 82 runs, then for all
the optical bands.

\subsection{Temporal auto-correlation function}

Study the temporal power spectrum:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let's start with plain Fourier transform and look at power spectra (we can 
    play games with co-addition, 6 columns for a given run, or all runs)
\item Potentially, we could also look at  Kelly and Becker code  (2014, ApJ 788, 33) 
\item Here we can compare to Chuck's CP measurements (in opsim db) 
\end{itemize}
