%  \section{Discussion and Conclusions} 
 
For now, a collection place for stuff from other seeing papers (commented out),
and some text to move later to Sections 3 and 4. 


1) \cite{VMT1998} 

For seeing prediction, it is tempting to find statistical laws which describe its temporal behaviour.
To our knowledge only three authors (Racine, 1996; Munoz-Tunon et al., 1997; Sarazin, 1997) 
have worked on this problem. 

- fig. 2: average autocorrelation function of seeing over 9 months:  A*exp(-t/tau) 

- seeing distribution is  log–normal, due to the fact that seeing arises from the addition of uncorrelated random processes

Following Racine (1996), they define a structure-function-like quantity
\begin{equation}
       f(\Delta t) = {| \theta(t+\Delta t) - \theta(t)| \over  \theta(t+\Delta t) + \theta(t) },
\end{equation} 
where $\theta$ is seeing. The mean value is
\begin{equation}
    < f(\Delta t) > =  f(\Delta t) ^\infty \, \left[ 1 - \exp(-\Delta t/\tau)^\gamma \right],
\end{equation} 
with $\tau$=17 min and $\gamma \sim 0.7$. for observations at Mauna Kea \cite{Racine1996}

Seeing varies greatly with time and seems to decorrelate after 1 to 2 hr. 

The seeing auto-correlation function
\begin{equation}
      C(\Delta t) = < \theta(t) \theta(t+\Delta t)>,
\end{equation} 
can be modeled as
\begin{equation}
      C(\Delta t) = A \, \exp(-\Delta t/\tau),
\end{equation} 
with $\tau \sim 1$ hour. 
 
Triple correlation:
\begin{equation}
      C(\Delta t_1, \Delta t_2) = < \theta(t) \theta(t+\Delta t_1)\theta(t+\Delta t_2) >
\end{equation} 

2) 

The vertical distribution of the optical turbulence strength (energy profile), described by the altitude 
dependence of the refractive-index structure constant $C^2_n$, is hard to measure. When $C^2_n$ 
is available, the seeing $\theta$ is obtained by integrating $C^2_n$ over altitude $h$ as 
\begin{equation}
   \theta =  0.98 {\lambda \over r_0} = 5.25 \, \lambda^{-1/5} \, \left[ \int_0^\infty C_n^2(h) dh \right]^{3/5},
\end{equation}
where $r_0$ is the Fried's parameter \cite{Roddier1981}.

\begin{equation} 
FWHM = 0.98 {\lambda \over r_0} 
\end{equation} 
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $r_0$ is the Fried's
parameter. It can be shown that the variation of $r_0$ with wavelength
predicted by the Kolmogorov's turbulence implies $FWHM \propto \lambda^{-0.2}$.
