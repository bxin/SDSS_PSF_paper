% Coulman (1985, ARAA 23, 19) for theory of turbulence and seeing in astronomy

\begin{equation} 
FWHM = 0.98 {\lambda \over r_0} 
\end{equation} 
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $r_0$ is the Fried's
parameter. It can be shown that the variation of $r_0$ with wavelength
predicted by the Kolmogorov's turbulence implies $FWHM \propto \lambda^{-0.2}$.

% The temporal behaviour of seeing:
% Using a large amount of data gathered during previous seeing campaign
% at ORM, we analyse the temporal evolution of seeing in order to find
% out whether predictions could be made over a short time interval of a
% few hours. The first results are presented.

% they give references for time scales (from 15 mins to 2 hours), also
% see a claim for 2 hour time scale:
