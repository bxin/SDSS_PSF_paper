The atmospheric seeing, the point-spread function (PSF) due to atmospheric turbulence, plays
a major role in ground-based astronomy. An adequate description of the PSF is critical for 
photometry, star-galaxy separation, and for unbiased measures of the shapes of nonstellar 
objects \citep{Lupton2001}. 

The vertical distribution of the optical turbulence strength, described by the altitude 
dependence of the refractive-index structure constant $C^2_n$, is hard to measure. 


The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, \citealt{York2000}) is a large-area multi-bandpass sky survey. 
The SDSS provides homogeneous and deep ($r\la22.5$) photometry in five bandpasses ($u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, 
and $z$, with effective wavelengths of 3551, 4686, 6166, 7480, and 8932 $\AA$), 
accurate to about 0.02 mag for unresolved sources not limited by photon statistics \citep{Sesar2007}. 
Astrometric positions are accurate to better than 0.1 arcsec per coordinate for sources with $r<20.5$ 
\citep{Pier2003}, and the morphological information from the images allows reliable star-galaxy separation 
to $r<21.5$ \citep{Lupton2002}.
 
The SDSS camera (Gunn et al. 1998) used drift-scanning observing mode (scanning along great circles
at the sidereal rate) and detected objects in the order 
$r-i-u-z-g$, with detections in two successive bands separated in time by 72 s. Each of the six camera
columns produces a 13.5 arcmin wide scan; the scans are split into fields 9.0 arcmin long, corresponding
to 36 seconds of time (the exposure time is 54.1 seconds because the sensor size is 2k by 2k pixels,
with 0.396 arcsec per pixel). 
The point-spread function (PSF) is estimated for each field and in each bandpass - there are about 
148 seeing estimates for each square degree of scanned sky. As a result, the SDSS measurements can
be used to explore the seeing dependence on time (on time scales from 1 minute to 10 hours) and 
wavelength (from the UV to the near-IR), as well as its angular correlation on the sky on scales from 
arcminutes to about 2.5 degrees. Thanks to large dynamic range for stellar brightness, the PSF can 
be traced to large radii ($\sim$30 arcsec) and compared to seeing profiles predicted by turbulence
theories. 

The SDSS seeing measurements represent an excellent database that has not been systematically 
explored yet. Here we utilize about a million SDSS seeing estimates to study the seeing profile 
and its behavior as a function of time and wavelength, and compare our results to theoretical 
expectations. In addition to direct scientific drivers, we are also motivated by the possibility 
to use seeing forecasts to optimize the efficiency of LSST observing strategy \citep{LSSToverview}.


{\bf Bo or ZI:} add a brief summary with a few references (e.g. Young, Tyson, Roddier,
Tokovinin papers) about what is known regarding:  PSF profile shape (e.g. Kolmogorov vs. von Karman), 
the dependence of FWHM on wavelength, and angular and temporal structure functions. 
An expanded version can go to Discussion and Conclusions section. 


The outline of this paper is as follows. In \S2, we give a brief description of the 
observations and the data used in analysis. We describe the PSF profile analysis, 
including estimatation method for the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) seeing
parameter, in \S3. In \S4, we analyse the dependence of FWHM on wavelength, and its angular 
and temporal structure functions. We discuss and present our conclusions in \S5.
