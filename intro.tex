ZI write a brief overview of SDSS and motivation for analysis (e.g. performance optimization
for LSST, \citealt{LSSToverview}): this shouldn't be hard and can be done in about a day. 

Hey Bo! Here is an example of using bibtex and cite call: SDSS PSF algorithm is described 
in \cite{Lupton2001}, \cite{Lupton2002}, and \citet[][see \S4.3]{SDSSEDR}.

Bo or ZI: add a brief summary with a few references (e.g. Young, Tyson, Roddier,
Tokovinin papers; can also recruit George for this part!) about what is known 
regarding:  PSF profile shape (e.g. Kolmogorov vs. von Karman), 
the dependence of FWHM on wavelength, and angular and temporal 
structure functions. 

Paper layout here.
